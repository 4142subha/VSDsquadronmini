The Virtual Disk Image (VDI) file shared in the WhatsApp group must first be downloaded. A pre-configured RISC-V toolchain environment is included in this file.Setting Up the Virtual Machine to Install VirtualBox: Download and install VirtualBox from the official website if it isn't already installed. furthermore build a new virtual machine Launch VirtualBox, then select "New."Select "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu (64-bit)" as the version when naming the virtual machine. Set aside a minimum of 20GB of hard disk space and 4GB of RAM. Include the VDI file.
Choose the freshly generated virtual machine (VM) in the VirtualBox Manager and click "Settings." Go to "Storage" and select "Add Hard Disk" under "Controller: SATA."After selecting "Existing Disk," find the VDI file you downloaded.After choosing the VDI file, press "OK." Launch the virtual machine.The pre-configured environment ought to boot up.
Open the terminal after the virtual machine has started. Revise the Package List Set up the dependencies. Create the DumpUpload object and upload it to GitHub. Set up a Git repository first. Include and Send Files Send to GitHubThese procedures will build a C program, set up the RISC-V toolchain, and produce an object dump on your virtual machine. Make sure to watch the videos for comprehensive instructions. The task can be finished by uploading the snapshots of your compiled C code and RISC-V objdump to your GitHub repository.

# clock cycle divider c program
To lower the frequency of a clock signal, utilize a clock cycle divider circuit. In digital circuits, this is frequently necessary because some components have a lower clock frequency requirement than the main system clock. A basic C program that emulates a clock cycle divider is shown below. The program will generate a lower frequency output by taking the input clock frequency and dividing it by a predetermined factor.
![pro 1](https://github.com/4142subha/VSDsquadronmini/assets/173649380/17d2fa30-7dce-4b6e-8643-2fb3acf5b40f)

Function clock_signal: This one divides the frequency of an input clock signal by a specified factor and mimics the creation of a clock signal.
frequency: The clock frequency of the input, expressed in Hz.
Divide the input clock frequency by the given factor, divide_factor.
The function tracks clock cycles using a straightforward counter (clock_count), and when the counter approaches the divide factor, it toggles the output clock signal (output_clock). Based on the input frequency, nanosleep is utilized to simulate the time interval between clock pulses.

# TASK 6
# PROJECT NAME 

Clock Cycle Divider - Crafting a Digital Clock Divider Circuit 

# OVERVIEW

The "Clock Cycle Divider" project uses a RISC-V processor to design and build a digital clock divider circuit. A clock divider, which lowers a clock signal's frequency and produces lower-frequency signals from a higher-frequency input, is a crucial part of digital systems. This is crucial for applications like digital signal processing, communication systems, and microprocessors that need synchronized processes at various clock speeds. Create the Circuit for the Clock Divider: Make a digital clock divider that generates a lower-frequency output from a high-frequency clock input. Apply with a RISC-V Processor: Control the clock division logic and the circuit's overall operation by utilizing the RISC-V processor. Aim for Efficiency Optimization Make sure the clock divider performs at its best and uses the least amount of power possible.Verify Functionality: To guarantee precise and dependable operation, test the clock divider circuit under various conditions.

# COMPONENTS REQUIRED

RISC-V Processor
Clock Source (Crystal Oscillator)
Clock Divider Circuit
Power Supply
Reset Circuit
Input/Output Interfaces (GPIO)
Debugging Interface (JTAG)

# CIRCUIT CONNECTION

Attach the RISC-V CPU's power pins as well as any extra components to the positive power supply, or Vcc. Connect the GND (ground) to the ground pins of the RISC-V CPU and other parts. Connect pin Clock of the RISC-V processor to output of the crystal oscillator. For stability, make sure capacitors are grounded and decoupled correctly. The clock divider circuit can be designed using flip-flops or dedicated clock divider integrated circuits (ICs). Connect the clock source's input to the clock divider. Connect the output of the clock divider to the appropriate pins on the RISC-V CPU to enable internal clocking. A pull-up or pull-down resistor is used to connect a reset button circuit to the reset pin of a RISC-V processor.Verify that the reset signal is steady and free of bounce.Overall Goal  The GPIO pins should be connected to headers or external components in order to interface with other circuits or peripherals.GPIO pins should be configured as inputs or outputs according on what your project requires. The JTAG interface pins must be connected to a debugging tool or header in order to program and debug.Check to make sure the signals for the TDI, TDO, TCK, and TMS are linked correctly, as well as the ground and power. If your project requires communication interfaces, attach the matching pins (such as UART, I2C, or SPI) to the external devices or headers.Verify that the voltage levels and signal integrity are appropriate to guarantee reliable communication.
